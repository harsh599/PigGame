# PigGame
A Dice based score generating game.

Here is a user friendly dice game with two players given,the one who reaches score of 100 first will be declared the winner and
automatically the whole game stops there and no other events associated with the elements would trigger.

After the user presses the newGame button only then the game restarts and players can again compete with each other in race of winning the game.

The screen shots of the game  will be added soon..... till then stay tuned......more projects are on the way....
